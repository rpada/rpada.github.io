BrowerHistory1 was really rough for me. I had just gotten a Mac computer and had to adjust to that plus figuring out how to do the code and servers. It took me longer than I’d like to admit to finally get my server connected by doing the “sudo” command. After that it was a little easier. The part I got really stuck on was doing the hyperlinks to link WITHIN the page. I tried it myself a few times but eventually gave in and watched the tutorial. It stumped me because I didn’t know you had to use a # and the ID tag is not something I’m super familiar with. Even watching back my video, I see some mistakes I made, such as misspelling the word “introduction” and wondering why the hyperlink wasn’t working. So I really learned that exact spelling is very important and one minor character mistake can ruin a whole page. It took me 5 tries to do WOD #1.

BrowserHistory2 took me the longest by far. I had a huge problem because whenever I would update my CSS it wouldn’t update on my page, despite me saving constantly and linking the CSS to my HTML. A Google search led me to solve the problem- the cache on my browser was saving the page as it was so whenever I reloaded it it wouldn’t update the changes I made in the CSS code. So I had to open Google Developer Tools and click “Disable cache.” This solved the problem and the CSS was updated. I also had a problem because I didn’t realize how important it was to put a semi-colon at the end of a line in CSS so I was wondering why the code wasn’t working. After 4 tries I finally got it to work completely, with some help from the tutorials.

BrowserHistory3 took only 2 tries for me, but granted I looked at the tutorial immediately because I didn’t know how to format the paragraphs based on the instructions. So I basically followed the code that was shown in the video to get it look right. The issues I had was wondering why the page wasn’t loading and then realizing I had to edit the URL to make it lead directly to the new folder and file I had made. Other than that, I really had no idea to create the code on my own. The very specific tags in the HTML and CSS were things I wasn’t aware of and would have never known on my own.
